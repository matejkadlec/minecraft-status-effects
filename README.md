Interactive website for browsing vanilla and modded Minecraft status effects (Minecraft 1.20/1.20.1).

Explore a fast, searchable table with detailed descriptions, multi-column sorting, advanced filtering, and pagination, plus light/dark themes and quick navigation by mod/effect. Export the data in CSV, Excel, or JSON for sharing or analysis.

## Project Status

The primary goal of this project was to build a clean, intuitive, and well-described table of Minecraft status effects for the modpack I was playing at the time. Many of the effects listed here were not documented elsewhere, so I often had to test them in-game or cross-reference the Chinese-language mcmod.cn wiki.

Beyond that, it was a chance to improve my JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python skills, as well as web design and QA. I took inspiration from the DataTables library in several areas and also ended up building a lightweight vanilla JavaScript table library as a spin-off of this project. That library is available [here](https://github.com/matejkadlec/vanilla-table).

Since these goals have been achieved, the project is currently inactive. That being said, I may return to it in the future and add more mod effects and update it for newer Minecraft versions (1.21+).

## Contributing

Though being inactive, PRs are welcome; I will review them when I have time. If you would like to become a collaborator and continue the project from where I left off, contact me via email `mat.kadlec@email.cz`. I also own the `minecraftstatuseffects.com` domain in case you would like to deploy it.

Also feel free to clone the repository, experiment with it, or reuse effect descriptions and sources from `data/effects.json` under the terms of the PolyForm Shield License (see `LICENSE.md`).
